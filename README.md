# The Obelix Manifesto #

Most every (euro) kid from my generation knows Obelix. Obelix, one of the protagonists in the *Asterix* series of French comic albums, is a friendly Gaul (Frenchman :-), living in a little village at the edge of Gaul (France :-) - the last little bit of territory in Gaul not yet occupied by Caesar's Roman legions in 50 BCE. The reason the village hasn't been overrun yet is that the village's druid knows the recipe of a magic potion giving incredible force and power to whoever drinks it. 

Obelix now fell into a cauldron with this magic potion as a child, and since then is perpetually strong - he doesn't need top-ups, so to say. Now an adult, he's a menhir cutter. Menhirs are massive, upright stones, probably used for some religious purpose, which can still be found in the landscape where Asterix and Obelix supposedly lived - the Breton area in France (footnote: these menhirs are a bit of a historical lie by the writers of Asterix: they were probably erected by people living in Europe about 4000 years before the Celtic Gauls did).
